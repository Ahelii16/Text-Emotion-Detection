# Text-Emotion-Detection

Using a set of 5 emojis [❤️ - heart, 
⚾ - ball, 
😁 - beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes,
😓 - downcast_face_with_sweat,
🍴 - fork_and_knife], the code analyzes the emotions of a sentence. The set can be further extended to include more emojis.

Sample predictions:
- He is ignoring my texts 😓
- I won the first prize in the race ⚾
- I had such a fun weekend at Manali 😁
- She is playing basketball with her friends ⚾
- My mom cooks so well ❤️
